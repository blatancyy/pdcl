Here at the PDCL community satisfaction is our main goal, and we are happy to help you optimize your experience with us!  If you wouldn't mind describing the problem or area of which you need help at to us it'd be much appreciated.  Once completed, one of our support agents will be with you shortly but please be patient!  Your report could be answered within the hour or a few hours from now depending on the time you create it, but regardless it will be answered in the professional fashion you deserve. If you wish to close your ticket, a member of staff will do so - however respect that there is a cooldown on ticket creations.`);
